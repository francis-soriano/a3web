# Web Design Assignment 3
Project Members: Vince Ortona, Francis Soriano, Jordan Tishler, Sam Pethick

# Design Document
## Layout
Typical consulting website; a navbar, a portfolio, testimonials, etc.
Will be using off from https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_startup.htm

**The group will work across the pages collaboratively; not restricting one person into one task.**

Need to change the template into the night mode (dark themed colours for cascading style sheets)

Transitions needed in the template to have better UX

### Navbar (jotishle)
 - space out the buttons
 - about (the consulting group) - contact information
 - home page
 - logo (high res)
 - above the fold
 - portfolio
 - demo page (vortona)
 - pricing (?)
 - street view "of the office" (google maps)


### Landing page (vortona)
 - remove social media icons (or retain... don't know what to put there yet)
 - one page, to retain the button to 
 - motto/catchphrase
 - need to have picture, but placeholder stuff for now

### About page (fsoriano)
- do a carousel for the about page
- mailto page (automatically opens your default mail app)
	- pre-filled with contact information or whatever user entry is
- location can be a street view image

### Portfolio page (spethic)
 - can also do a carousel for products
 - different types of portfolios; for programming/automation and cartography content
 - captions for images

### Demo page (vortona)
 - TBD
 - can be a leaflet app
 - cesium js ... possibly
